While one of the least populated provincial capital cities with a population base of less than 60 thousand residents, it offers a wide spectrum of venues and is a government, university and cultural hub.\nAs the city grows and develops, it becomes increasingly important to examine and understand it. The City of Fredericton provides open data for everyone and encourages entrepreneurial use to develop services for the benefit of its citizens. The purpose of this Project is to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood. It will help people making smart decision on selecting appropriate neighborhood. It will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life. Developers, investors, policy makers and/or city planners have an interest in the need for additional services and citizen protection.\n\n\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# PROBLEM"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "\u2022\tWhich neighborhoods have the highest crime?\n\u2022\tIs population density correlated to crime level?\n\u2022\tUsing foursquare data, what venues are most common in different locations within the city?\n\u2022\tDoes the Knowledge Park really need a coffee shop?\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
